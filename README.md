EXPOSE 3000

# 7. Command to run the app

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the terminal from the root of your application directory:

docker build -t my-web-app .
STEP 6: Start the App Using Docker Compose
Run this command:
docker-compose up
âœ… Now open your browser and go to:
